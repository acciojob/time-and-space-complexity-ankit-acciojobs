    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the size of its input. 
        It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. 
        It is often expressed using big-O notation, such as O(n), to describe its growth rate.
